brief: "A learning management system for JR Academy staffs, teachers & students"
content: "JR Academy was founded in 2017 and has become Australia's largest Chinese IT organisation with over 10,000 active members in our community and over 400 staff across China and Australia. "
description: "The JR Dashboard website was originally developed as a learning management system for JR Academy staffs, teachers & students to sign up for the Academy's courses. As demand grew and the JR Academy expanded, they realized that they needed a better digital experience when studying in JR Academy. I worked with them to transform their website into a place where students could sign up for in-person classes and have access to a plethora of educational resources at their fingertips."
